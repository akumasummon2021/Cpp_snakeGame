have met mary problems, last 3 days, and finally solve all the problems, if someone want to build the final in your local machine in the same environment, maybe this article can help you:

zip download: you should download the file: SDL2-devel-2.0.20-VC.zip in the sdl homepage and unpack it somewhere
in SDL2-Folder: you should add a File called SDL2Config.cmake, contents:
set(SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/include")
# Support both 32 and 64 bit builds
if (${CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P} MATCHES 8)
  set(SDL2_LIBRARIES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/lib/x64/SDL2main.lib;${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/lib/x64/SDL2.lib")
else ()
  set(SDL2_LIBRARIES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/lib/x86/SDL2main.lib;${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/lib/x86/SDL2.lib")
endif ()
string(STRIP "${SDL2_LIBRARIES}" SDL2_LIBRARIES)
3. in cmakelist.txt in snakegame-Folder: you should add this in txt before "find_package":

# adjust to your SDL2-Folder
set(SDL2_DIR "C:/Works/Git/CppSnake/SDL2") 
# adjust to your SDL2-Folder
include_directories("C:/Works/Git/CppSnake/SDL2/include")
4. in building may be you will get some error information from:

string(STRIP ${SDL2_LIBRARIES} SDL2_LIBRARIES)
if so, just comment it out.

5. if you get this information from building:

C:/Works/Git/CppSnake/SDL2/lib/x64/SDL2main.lib(x64/Release/SDL_windows_main.obj):(.text$mn+0x84): undefined reference to `SDL_wcslen'

C:/Works/Git/CppSnake/SDL2/lib/x64/SDL2main.lib(x64/Release/SDL_windows_main.obj):(.text$mn+0x18e): undefined reference to `SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox'
please change your main.cpp like that:

int main(int argv, char** args)
with these steps you can build your project successfully, but, you still can't run the Snakegame.exe. Because the .exe need the .dll file.

6. the SDL2.dll is in SDL2 Folder. You can copy it to the build Folder of your project, now you can run the executable successfully ^^
